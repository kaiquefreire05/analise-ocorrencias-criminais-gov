Violence and crime are complex problems that have affected Brazilian society for decades. These problems have serious consequences for people's lives, including human losses, material damage and economic losses.
To better understand these problems and develop more effective public policies to combat them, it is important to perform data analysis.
In this project, we will analyze a dataset of criminal occurrences by federative unit in Brazil.

Data analysis will allow us to:

 * Identify trends and patterns of crime in Brazil;
 * Compare the situation of different federative units in relation to crime;
 * Propose hypotheses about the factors that may contribute to crime;
 * Evaluate the effectiveness of public security policies.

Data collection

The dataset was made available by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security and contains information on the number of occurrences, nature of the recorded fact, victim profile, perpetrator profile, means used, among others.

Goals

The objectives of this project are:

* Identify the main trends and patterns of crime in Brazil;
* Compare the situation of different federative units in relation to crime
* Identify factors that may contribute to crime.
